This project was done as part of Corporate user directory project to familiarize with AWS services. The application aims at storing employee data.
The initial implementation was done based on a youtube tutorial by another github user hshar94.

The initial architecture was modified to store user credentials using Amazon Cognito and Okta user authentication. Amazon Cloudfront is also used for secure 
connection. Here AWS-EC2 acts as server and RDS is used for storage of employee table with details like name, salary, email, vacation balance.. etc and S3 for 
the image of the employee. The application webpage provides customized views for employees or hr/admin. 
The project is mainly aimed at understanding how different AWS services interact with each other.
